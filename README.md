    A single binary for service monitoring for latency and SSL certification, vault for secrets and sensitive data, and a config store with small to medium scale workload that can run in tiniest of computers.

#### React (with TS) developers are welcomed for WebUI for this project.

#### NOTE : WIP, currently in v0.1.0

## Features

- Uses SQLite which enables it to be deployed in VM as much as $5 a month.
- Continues monitoring of service (at certain interval) and noting unexpected results w.r.t latency and status code.
- SSL Monitoring with gathering of its expiry date.
- Storage for secrets with encryption.
- Config store.
- Extremely easy to setup and get up.

## Contributions

Vyoza is in very early phase and is open to contributions, but we recommend creating an issue or replying in a comment to let me know what you are working on first that way we don't overwrite each other.

### See Makefile for running locally.
